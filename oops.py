# -- Question -----
# WAP to create a class that takes name and marks of 3 subject as arguments  in constructor. Then create a method to print the avreage of the marks of the students

#             avg_marks = sum / len(self.marks)
#         return avg_marks
    

# stu_marks = StudentMarks("Sujeet", [87, 90, 78])

# ---- Static Method --------------------------------

# methods that does not use the self parameter (work at class level)
# exampe can be used

# class statc_method:
#     @staticmethod  # this decorator is used to define a static method in python
#     def without_self_keyword():
#         return "This is method without self"

# print(s.without_self_keyword())


# -------- access specifiers (private, protected, and public) --------------------------------
# Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

# Public: Public members (variables or methods) are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.
#Protected: Protected members are indicated by a single underscore (_) prefix. 
# These are not strictly enforced as protected but are treated as a convention to suggest they should not be accessed directly outside the class or its subclasses.
# Private: Private members are indicated by a double underscore (__) prefix. 
# These are "name-mangled" to prevent direct access from outside the class, though they can still be accessed indirectly.

class Sample:
    def __init__(self):
        self.public_var = "I am Public"  # Public variable
        self._protected_var = "I am Protected"  # Protected variable
        self.__private_var = "I am Private"  # Private variable

    def public_method(self):
        print("This is a Public method")

    def _protected_method(self):
        print("This is a Protected method")

    def __private_method(self):
        print("This is a Private method")

    def access_private_method(self):
        # Accessing private method from within the class
        self.__private_method()

# Create an object of the Sample class
obj = Sample()

# Accessing public members
print(obj.public_var)  # Output: I am Public
obj.public_method()    # Output: This is a Public method

# Accessing protected members (can be accessed, but not recommended)
print(obj._protected_var)  # Output: I am Protected
obj._protected_method()    # Output: This is a Protected method

# Accessing private members (will cause an AttributeError if accessed directly)
# print(obj.__private_var)  # This will raise an AttributeError

# Access private member through name mangling (though not recommended)
print(obj._Sample__private_var)  # Output: I am Private
obj._Sample__private_method()    # Output: This is a Private method

# Accessing private members through a public method
obj.access_private_method()  # Output: This is a Private method

# ------- ------ Key Points: --------------------------------
# Public members (like public_var) can be accessed from anywhere.
# Protected members (like _protected_var) can be accessed but are conventionally meant to be used only within the class or subclasses.
# Private members (like __private_var) cannot be directly accessed outside the class, but name mangling (_ClassName__varname) allows access indirectly. 
# This is mainly a way to prevent accidental access, not complete enforcement.




# ----- Inheritance in Python --------------------------------
